ccess control is the means to limit what the user can do what. User can be limited by role or user. Handling access control by role is the simplest way to go about and the most flexible.

RBAC is the acronym for role-based access control and roles can be customized for management. There are libraries can  be used in Node to help with this.

When defining an RBAC model, the following conventions are useful:

S = Subject = A person or automated agent
R = Role = Job function or title which defines an authority level
P = Permissions = An approval of a mode of access to a resource
SE = Session = A mapping involving S, R and/or P
SA = Subject Assignment
PA = Permission Assignment
RH = Partially ordered Role Hierarchy. RH can also be written: ≥ (The notation: x ≥ y means that x inherits the permissions of y.)
A subject can have multiple roles.
