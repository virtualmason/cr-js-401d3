JWT is not primarly for transfer of secure information, it's to verify a person is authorized to do soemthing. It exposes the inromation so putting private information in it is not a good idea. It is made up aof a header, body, signature. The header which notes the type of the token and the signing slgoritim. The body which is the information and the signature wheich is the signature is made up of the header, payload and secret pw used to encode the infromation so all perteis know the information has not been changed.
