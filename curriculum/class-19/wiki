Rooms and Namespaces

Socket.IO allows you to “namespace” your sockets, which essentially means assigning different endpoints or paths. This is a useful feature to minimize the number of resources (TCP connections) and at the same time separate concerns within your application by introducing separation between communication channels.
const nsp = io.of('/my-namespace');
nsp.on('connection', function(socket){
  console.log('someone connected');
});
nsp.emit('hi', 'everyone!');
